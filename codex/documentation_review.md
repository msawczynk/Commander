# Documentation Review

The main `README.md` links to external documentation at <https://docs.keeper.io/secrets-manager/commander-cli/overview>.

The page title is:
```
Commander Overview | Keeper Documentation
```
It describes the Keeper Commander CLI for IT admins, DevOps and developers and includes an overview of features and setup instructions.

## Enhancement Suggestions

* Include a short summary of installation steps directly in the repository `README.md` so users can get started quickly without visiting the external site.
* Add a section on running tests and contributing guidelines.
* Provide examples of common commands in the `README.md` for quick reference.
