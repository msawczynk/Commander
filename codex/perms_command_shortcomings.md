# Potential Shortcomings of the `perms` Command

The implementation in `keepercommander/commands/perms_command.py` is designed for automation but has a few limitations:

1. **Minimal Validation**
   - `validate_csv` only checks for file existence. It does not verify column names or permission values. Invalid input may lead to runtime errors during `apply`.
2. **Error Handling**
   - Many operations rely on network API calls. Failures (e.g., connectivity issues or missing vault records) are logged but not raised, which can make debugging difficult.
3. **Fixed Config Record**
   - The command stores artifacts in a record titled "Perms Config". If the record is deleted or renamed, commands may fail until recreated.
4. **Team Lookup**
   - Team names are matched exactly. Typos in the CSV cause "Team not found" errors that stop permission updates for that row.
5. **Scalability**
   - `apply_permissions` processes each CSV row sequentially and performs multiple API calls per record/team. Large CSV files may result in long execution times.
6. **Limited Unit Tests**
   - Prior to this update, there were no automated tests covering `perms`. The new tests focus on high-level invocation but do not exercise the full API integration.
7. **Interactive Mode**
   - Interactive prompts pause execution for user input, which may not be desirable in automated environments.

Consider these factors when relying on `perms` for large-scale or unattended automation.
